This is a test program I made to control the charging of my Marstek Venus using the data from the P1 port of my electricity meter.

For the rs485 modbus, I use a [Sollae CSW-H85K](https://www.eztcp.com/en/products/csw-h85k).

For P1, I use a [Sollae EZL-200F-E](https://www.eztcp.com/en/products/ezl-200f).
